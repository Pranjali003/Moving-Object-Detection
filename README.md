# Moving-Object-Detection
This project involves detecting moving objects in video streams or camera feeds using computer vision techniques. The goal is to efficiently identify objects in motion and differentiate them from static backgrounds. Moving Object Detection can be applied in various fields such as surveillance, traffic monitoring, and human-computer interaction.

âœ¨Technologies Used:

1.OpenCV for video capture and image processing
2.NumPy for efficient array manipulations
3.Python for the core implementation

Features:

1.Background Subtraction: Removes the static parts of the scene, focusing on detecting changes in the frame.
2.Motion Tracking: Tracks detected objects across multiple frames.
3.Noise Reduction: Reduces false positives by filtering out small, irrelevant movements like lighting changes or camera noise.
4.Bounding Boxes: Draws boxes around moving objects for easy visualization.
5.Multi-Object Detection: Detects and tracks multiple objects simultaneously.
6.Real-time Processing: Processes video frames in real-time, ensuring responsive detection.
